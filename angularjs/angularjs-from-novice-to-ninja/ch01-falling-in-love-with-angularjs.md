AngularJS is a **framework that extends HTML** by teaching it **new syntax**, making it suitable for developing really great **web applications**.

With AngularJS, you can introduce **new HTML elements** and **custom attributes**.

AngularJS has been designed from ground up with **TDD** (Test Driven Development) in mind.

The Power Features of AngularJS
=======

 1. Two-way Data Binding
-----------------------
In AngularJS we create templates and bind different components with specific models.

2. Structure front end code
---------------------------
With AngularJS you're going to build *solid*, *well-structured*, and *fully testable* apps. This saves you from maintenance nightmares and make your project much easier.

AngularJS is an **MVW** (Model-View-Whatever) framework where **Whatever** means **Whatever Works for You**. The reason is that AngularJS can be used both as **MVC** and **MVVM** framework.
