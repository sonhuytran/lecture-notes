=======
AngularJS is a **framework that extends HTML** by teaching it **new syntax**, making it suitable for developing really great **web applications**.

With AngularJS, you can introduce **new HTML elements** and **custom attributes**.

AngularJS has been designed from ground up with **TDD** (Test Driven Development) in mind.

The Power Features of AngularJS
=======

1. Two-way Data Binding
-----------------------
In AngularJS we create templates and bind different components with specific models.

2. Structure front end code
---------------------------
With AngularJS you're going to build *solid*, *well-structured*, and *fully testable* apps. This saves you from maintenance nightmares and make your project much easier.

AngularJS is an **MVW** (Model-View-Whatever) framework where **Whatever** means **Whatever Works for You**. The reason is that AngularJS can be used both as **MVC** and **MVVM** framework.

3. Rooting Support
------------------
Single Page Apps (SPAs) load the content **asynchronously** on the same page and just change the URL in the browser to reflect it. It makes users feel as if they are interacting with desktop apps.

With AngularJS rooting support, you can create different views for different URLs. AngularJS will load the appropriate view in the main page when a specific URL is requested. We are dividing our app into different parts and thereby making it more maintainable.
