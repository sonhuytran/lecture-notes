## Falling In Love With AngularJS ##

=======
AngularJS is a **framework that extends HTML** by teaching it **new syntax**, making it suitable for developing really great **web applications**.

With AngularJS, you can introduce **new HTML elements** and **custom attributes**.

AngularJS has been designed from ground up with **TDD** (Test Driven Development) in mind.

The Power Features of AngularJS
=======

1. Two-way Data Binding
-----------------------
In AngularJS we create templates and bind different components with specific models.

2. Structure front end code
---------------------------
With AngularJS you're going to build *solid*, *well-structured*, and *fully testable* apps. This saves you from maintenance nightmares and make your project much easier.

AngularJS is an **MVW** (Model-View-Whatever) framework where **Whatever** means **Whatever Works for You**. The reason is that AngularJS can be used both as **MVC** and **MVVM** framework.

3. Rooting Support
------------------
Single Page Apps (SPAs) load the content **asynchronously** on the same page and just change the URL in the browser to reflect it. It makes users feel as if they are interacting with desktop apps.

AngularJS support **rooting** with **multiple views** for different URLs: it will load the appropriate view in the main page when a specific URL is requested. We are dividing our app into different parts and thereby making it more maintainable.

4. Templating
-------------
AngularJS uses **plain old HTML** as the templating language, which makes designers and developers' jobs independent to each others.

5. Form validation
------------------
AngularJS forms incorporate **real-time form validations**, **custom validators**, **formatters**, etc. with several **CSS control state classes**.

6. Directives
-------------
Directives trick HTML into doing **new things** that are not supported natively. This is done by introducing **new elements/attributes** and teaching the **new syntax** to HTML.

7. Embeddable, testable and injectable
--------------------------------------
You can easily embed an AngularJS app within **another app**, or use it along with **other technologies**.

AngularJS favors **TDD**, supports **unit** and **End-to-End testing**.

AngularJS provides full support for **Dependency Injection**.

8. Powered by Google and an active community
--------------------------------------------
AngularJS is **open-source**, maintained by **Google** developers, released under **MIT** license and available for **download at GitHub**. The **documentation** is also pretty good. The number of developers using it is also increasing with great **tutorials** all over the web.

Download and Installation
=========================

Installation via CDN
--------------------
Put this inside the `<head/>` tag of the document:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.js"></script>
or minified version:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.2.16/angular.min.js"></script>

Note: even-numbered versions are **stable** releases, while odd-numbered ones are for *developers only*.
