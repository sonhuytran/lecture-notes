In common usage, « construction » refers to *the process of building*, which might include some aspects of planning, designing, and checking your work, but mostly refers to *the hands-on part of creating something*.

# 1.1. What is Software Construction?

There are numerous distinct activities that go into software developement, including:

- problem definition
- requirements developement
- construction planning
- software architecture, or high-level design
- detailed design
- coding and debugging
- unit testing
- integration testing
- integration
- system testing
- corrective maintenance

Here are some specific tasks involved in construction:

- verifying that the groundwork has been laid so that construction can proceed successfully
- determining how your code will be tested
- designing and writing classes and routines
- creating and naming variables and named constants
- selecting control structures and organizing blocks of statements
- unit testing, integration testing, and debugging your own code
- reviewing other team members' low-level designs and code and having them review yours
- polishing code by carefully formatting and commenting it
- integrating software components that were created separately
- tuning code to make it faster and use fewer resources

Important nonconstruction activites include:

- management
- requirements development
- software architecture
- user-interface design
- system testing
- maintenance

# 1.2. Why is Software Construction Important?

Improving software quality and developer productivity is important, because *many of the fundamentals are the same*. But software construction is important because:

- **Construction is a large part of software developement**: it typically takes 30-80% of the total time spent on a project.
- **Construction is the central activity in software development**: after requirements & architecture, before system testing.
- **With a focus on construction, the individual programmer's productivity can improve enormously**: the productivity of individual programmers varied by a factor of 10 or 20 during construction.
- **Construction's product, the source code, is often the only accurate description of the software**: other documents can be out of date, but the source code is always up to date. Consequently, it's imperative that the source code be of the highest possible quality.
- **Construction is the only activity that's guaranteed to be done**: imperfect, real-world projects often skip requirements and design to jump into construction; they drop testing because they have too many errors to fix and they've run out of time. But YOU CANNOT DROP CONSTRUCTION.
