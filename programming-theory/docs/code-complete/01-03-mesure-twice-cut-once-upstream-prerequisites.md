[TOC]

This chapter describes the work that must be done to prepare for software construction. The carpenter's saying, "Measure twice, cut once" is highly relevant to the construction part of software development, which can account for as much as 65% of the total project costs. The worst software projects end up doing construction two or three times or more. Doing the most expensive part of the project twice is as bad as an idea in software as it is in any other line of work.

# 3.1. Importance of Prerequisites

> A common denominator of programmers who build high-quality software is their use of high-quality practices, which emphasize quality at the beginning (planning), middle (construction), and end (system testing) of a project.

In software development, you do planning when you define the problem, when you specify the solution, and when you design the solution.

## Do Prerequisites Apply to Modern Software Project?

Projects will run best if **appropriate preparation activities** are done before construction begins in earnest.

The overarching goal of preparation is **risk reduction**: a good planner clears major risks out of the way as early as possible so that the bulk of the project can proceed as smoothly as possible. The specific must be decided project by project.

## Causes of Incomplete Preparation

- Developers do not have the **expertise** to carry out their assignments, to perform preparation activities like planning a project, creating a compelling business case, developing comprehensive and accurate requirements, creating high-quality architectures, etc.
- Programmers can not **resist** the urge to begin coding as soon as possible.
- **Managers are notoriously unsympathetic** to programmers who spend time on construction prerequisites.

## Utterly Compelling and Foolproof Argument for Doing Prerequisites Before Construction

### Appeal to Logic

- Management point of view: planning means determining the amount of time, number of people, number of computers needed.
- Technical point of view: planning means understanding what you want to build so that you don't waste money building the wrong thing.

### Appeal to Analogy

You have to do things in the right order in software like in other works, and programmers are **at the end of the software food chain**. In programming, if you have healthy food at each stage in the food chain, the result is healthy code written by happy programmers.

> A builder who is building a housing development doesn't need to know every detail of every house before constructing the first house. But he surveys the site, maps out sewer and electrical lines, etc. 

### Appeal to Data

In general, the principle is to find the error as close as possible to the time at which it was introduced.

### Boss-Readiness Test

Which of these statements are self-fulfilling prophecies ?

- We'd better start coding right away because we're going to have a lot of debugging to do.
- We haven't planned much time for testing because we're not going to find many defects
- We've investigated requirements and design so much that I can't think of any major problems we'll run into during coding and debugging.

All of them, aim for the last one.

# 3.2. Determine the Kind of Software You're Working On

Different kinds of software (business systems, mission-critical systems, embedded life-critical systems) call for different balances between preparation & construction, e.g:

- Bussiness systems projects tend to benefit from highly iterative approaches, in which planning, requirements, and architecture are interleaved with construction, system testing, and quality-assurance activities.
- Life-critical systems tend to require more sequential approaches - requirements stability is part of what's needed to ensure ultrahigh levels of reliability.
